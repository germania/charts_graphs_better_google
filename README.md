charts_graphs_better_google
===========================

API module for Drupal Charts and Graphs 
(http://drupal.org/project/charts_graphs) to add 
support for Google's JSAPI charts 
(https://developers.google.com/chart/).

This module currently only supports D6, as Charts and Graphs releases a 
stable D7 module I will try to keep it updated.

## To Use
 - Install the latest version of Charts and Graphs
 - cd sites/all/modules and git clone https://github.com/germania/charts_graphs_better_google
 - Enable the module inside Drupal's admin panel
 - Choose "Google Charts 2" as your chart API
